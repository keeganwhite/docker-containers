# Traefik Container Management 
The easiest way to run this code is by creating an iNethi environment, so you have the necessary architecture in place
to use this code. Find a GUI builder for iNethi [here](https://github.com/iNethi/gui-installer).

## Prerequisites
1. Traefik running
2. Keycloak running
3. A keycloak client running matching your docker-compose environment variables. You can import the maintain.json file 
into keycloak that is located [here](./maintain.json).

## Running the code
Run the docker-compose.yml file once you have edited the environment/argument variables that will be parsed at build
time:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
